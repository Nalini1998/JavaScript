### **WEB DEVELOPMENT**
# **Project: Piano Keys**

We're a web developer who has been hired by a music education company. This client wants we to create an interactive game to help their beginner-level piano students study. Create a piano player with DOM events in JavaScript!

<br>

# **Tasks**

## **Create An Interactive Piano Game**
#### **1. Create and process the `keyPlay` function**

At the beginning of the code, we have variable name assignments for the keys array and the notes array. There is also a function looping through the elements of the keys array and pushing them to the notes array.


After the second comment, create a function named `keyPlay` that changes the background color of the keys when they are pressed down.

Be sure to use the .target property in the function because the target is being modified in this case.


<br>

#### **2. Create and process the keyReturn function**
Next, create a function named keyReturn that returns the background color of the keys to their default with an empty string '' when the mouse is released on the element. Be sure to use the .target property.


<br>

#### **3. Create a named function and leave the code blank**
Now that we have created two functions that change the color of the key elements, We must assign them as the values of event handler properties.

Create a named function and leave the code block blank for now. This function will be used later on to assign events to the keys, so it should take one parameter â€” We can call it note.

<br>

#### **4. Create an event handler that runs the `keyPlay`**
Inside the function, create an event handler that runs the `keyPlay` as an event handler when a `mousedown` event fires on any note.


<br>

#### **5. Create a second event handler property**
Inside the function, create a second event handler property that runs the keyReturn when a `mouseup` event fires on any note.

<br>

#### **6. Create a .forEach loop that will pass the elements in the notes array**
At the beginning of the code, we have variable name assignments for the keys array and the empty notes array. There is also a function looping through the keys array and pushing the keys elements to the notes array to be assigned a variable name.

Now, We must create a .forEach loop that will pass the elements in the notes array through Wer event assignment function.

<br>

#### **7. Run our code and see how it works!**
_Now, the program knows what to do when each piano key has a `mousedown` or `mouseup` event fired on it. Run our code and see how it works!_

<br>

#### **8. Create an event handler with a click event on the nextOne**
Next, there are variables that represent the progress buttons in the song box below that allow students to progress the piano.

The nextOne, nextTwo, nextThree, and startOver change the lyrics and musical notes of the song to help the student play along. In the beginning of the song the only button the student needs is nextOne. Because of this the .hidden properties of the other buttons are assigned the value of true.

Now We must create events on all the progress buttons. First, create an event handler property with a click event on the nextOne element.

<br>

#### **9. Make the following changes to the button that appears after nextOne is clicked**
To begin modifying the song box, We must switch the progress buttons first.

Using an anonymous event handler function, make the following changes to the button that appears after nextOne is clicked:

Reveal the nextTwo button by changing the .hidden property to make the nextTwo button appear.
Hide the nextOne button by changing the .hidden property to hide the nextOne button.

<br>

#### **10. Add the following changes to the nextOne event handler function**
Next, a click event firing on the nextOne must change the music notes that guide the piano student through the song.

Add the following changes to the nextOne event handler function so the musical notes change when the button is clicked.

- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-five to D.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-six to C.

<br>

#### **11. Make the following changes to the button that appears after nextTwo is clicked**
Create another event handler property with a click event on the button element called nextTwo. Then assign the property to the value of an anonymous event handler function.

<br>

#### **12. Add the following changes to the nextTwo event handler function**
Make the following changes to the button that appears when nextTwo is clicked:

- Reveal the nextThree button by changing the .hidden property to make the nextThree button appear.
- Hide the nextTwo button by changing the .hidden property to hide the nextTwo button.

<br>

#### **13. Make the following changes to the lyrics in the function**
Once the student has reached this point of the Happy Birthday song the lyrics changes from HAP-PY BIRTH-DAY TO We to HAP-PY BIRTH-DAY DEAR FRI-END.

Make the following changes to the lyrics in the function when the button is clicked:

- Change the content of the element with an ID of word-five to DEAR.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of word-six to FRI-.

<br>

#### **14. Add a statement to the event handler function for nextTwo**
Now We have the lyrics HAP-PY BIRTH-DAY DEAR FRI-. To finish the line, We must add the -END to the song box under the piano.

The -END element is stored in the lastLyric variable.

Add a statement to the event handler function for nextTwo that changes the display property of lastLyric to 'inline-block'.

<br>

#### **15. Add the following changes to the nextTwo event handler**
A click event firing on the second button must also change the music notes to guide the piano student through the song.

Add the following changes to the nextTwo event handler function so the musical notes change when the button is clicked:

- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-three to G.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-four to E.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-five to C.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-six to B.

<br>

#### **16. Create an event handler property with a click event on the nextThree element**

<br>

#### **17. Make the following changes to the button that appears when nextThree is clicked**
Using an anonymous event handler function, make the following changes to the button that appears when nextThree is clicked:

Reveal the startOver button by changing the .hidden property to make the startOver button appear.
Hide the nextThree button by changing the .hidden property to hide the nextThree button.

<br>

#### **18. Add the following changes to the nextThree event handler function**
Add the following changes to the nextThree event handler function so the lyrics change when this button is clicked.

- Change the content of the element with an ID of word-one to HAP-.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of word-two to PY.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of word-three to BIRTH.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of word-four to DAY
- Change the content of the element with an ID of word-five to TO.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of word-six to We!.

<br>

#### **19. Add the following changes to the nextThree event handler**
Add the following changes to the nextThree event handler function so the musical notes change when the button is clicked.

- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-one to F.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-two to F.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-three to E.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-four to C.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-five to D.
- Change the content of the element with an ID of letter-note-six to C.

<br>

#### **20. Add a statement to the event handler function for nextThree**

Add a statement to the event handler function for nextThree that changes the display property of lastLyric back to 'none'.

<br>

#### **21. Review**

_Congrats us, We've completed the Piano Player! Play around with the piano and the song box to fire all the events._
