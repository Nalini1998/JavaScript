# **Project: Responsive Club Website**

## **Overview:**
​
This Project is slightly different than others I have encountered thus far. Instead of a _step-by-step_ tutorial, this Project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the Project I’ll be building. 

There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and I should expect to use the Internet and other resources when I encounter a problem that I cannot easily solve.​

## **Project Goals**

In this Project, I’ll be building **My own club group page** that will dynamically respond as I adjust the size of My screen!​

## **Prerequisites**


### **1. To complete this Project**
We should have knowledge the _Responsive Design_, or the same documents guide us _How to Build Websites Path?_.


### **2. I’ll build a webpage for a local club**
In this Project, I’ll build a webpage for a local club. I can base it on _real-life_ organization I belong to or make one up! 
I’ll get to choose everything about _**My page**_: The _club name_, _the page layout_, _styling_, and _any images_ that I want to use, _etc._ 


### **3. My Project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools. 

In my Project, I used `percentages` and `relative units`, such as `em` and `rem`, in my **CSS** to _size_ and _position_ page elements. I also made my _website responsive_ by incorporating `media queries` to `resize` elements based on the `size` of the `screen`.

Possible responsive design _concepts_ to demonstrate:​

Making _**images**_ toggle to certain **percentages** in terms of `width` after a certain _**minimum screen size**_.
Using a `@media` rule to change `page layout` and behavior based on `size` breakpoints.
Employing responsive units `em` and `rem` to `size` and `space` elements with `width` and `padding`.

## **Project Solution**

### **4. Review and Reference**

_Great work!_ You can refer to my Code and compare them with each other. I can also learn how to host My own solution on **GitHub** so I would like to share this one with other people!

Please keep in mind that this is just a possible solution. **Your own Project** can be coded totally differently, have more or less content, and look totally different! 
I am providing my Solution for you to get a sense of one way to use `responsive units` and `media queries` to affect `page laIt`. There are multiple ways to solve these Projects, and I’ll learn more by seeing others’ Code.
