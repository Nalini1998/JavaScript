### **BUILDING INTERACTIVE WEBSITES**
# **Secret Message**

Using array methods, we will transform an array of strings into a **secret message**!

We should consult the **Mozilla Developer Network** _(MDN)_ for reference on any method with which I am not familiar.

<br>

# **Tasks**

#### **1. Use an array method to remove the last string of the array secretMessage.**

<br>

#### **2. Great! We can check our work by logging the .length of the array.**

At this point, the length should be 1 less than the original length.

<br>

#### **3. Use an array method to add the words to and Program as separate strings to the end of the secretMessage array.**

<br>

#### **4. Change the word easily to the word right by accessing the index and replacing it.**

<br>

#### **5. Use an array method to remove the first string of the array.**

<br>

#### **6. Use an array method to add the string Programming to the beginning of the array.**

<br>

#### **7. Use an array method to remove the strings get, right, the, first, time, and replace them with the single string know,**

<br>

#### **8. On one line, use console.log() and .join() to print the secret message as a sentence.**
