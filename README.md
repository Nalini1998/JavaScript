# **Introduction**

In *web development*, **asynchronous** programming is notorious for being a challenging topic.

An **asynchronous** operation is one that allows the computer to “move on” to other tasks while waiting for the **asynchronous** operation to complete. **asynchronous** programming means that time-consuming operations don’t have to bring everything else in our programs to a halt.

There are countless examples of asynchronicity in our everyday lives. Cleaning our house, for example, involves **asynchronous** operations such as a dishwasher washing our dishes or a washing machine washing our clothes. While we wait on the completion of those operations, we’re free to do other chores.

Similarly, *web development* makes use of **asynchronous** operations. Operations like making a network request or querying a database can be time-consuming, but **JavaScript** allows us to execute other tasks while awaiting their completion.

*This lesson will teach you how modern **JavaScript** handles asynchronicity using the Promise object, introduced with ES6. Let’s get started!*
