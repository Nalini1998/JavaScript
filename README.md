# **`error` Handling Review**

_Great job with `handling errors`!_

_-_ How mistakes in programming leads to `errors`;

_-_ Why `errors` are useful for developers;

_-_ `errors` will prevent a program from executing unless it is handled;

_-_ How to create an `error` using the `error`() function;

_-_ How to `throw` an `error` *object* using the `throw` keyword;

_-_ How to use the `try`...`catch` statement to handle thrown `errors`;

_-_ Evaluating code in a `try` block to anticipate `errors`;

_-_ Catching the `error` in a `catch` block to allow our program to continue running;

_-_ Why the `try`...`catch` statement would be useful in a program;

_-_ Now we have the ability to create code that doesnâ€™t break when an `error` is thrown!

# **Instructions**

_If we want to challenge ourselves:_

_-_ Force different built-in `error` *object* to be thrown in a `try`...`catch` statement and see when the messages are different;

_-_ Test out what different data types we can `throw`;

_-_ Use `try`...`catch` for a function that accepts user input to allow `errors` to be thrown but your program to continue running.
